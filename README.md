# rshell
This is the repository of the HW0, rshell. I have been struggling with git and I hope I'll learn one day. By now I am not sure if I am updating everything right or not and I feel I am going to cry... I am the whole week doing this and I feel like I do not program there is a long time... OH WAIT!... There is a long time :( 

# Installation
To execute the program just follow the steps:
<br>1 - Download the project
<br>2 - Open the terminal
<br>3- Go inside of the directory rshell by typing:
<br>`cd <path of the directory here>/rshell`
<br>4 - Once you are in the right directory, just type 
<br>`$ make` 
<br>After that, if you want to run the software, type:
<br>`$ make run`
<br>to run the software or;
<br>`$ make leak-check`
<br>to check some memory leaks;

# Dependencies
By now this software do not use any external library.

#Bugs/Limitations/Issues
Sometimes occurs unexpected erros which seems to be something releated with the mallocs that the new operator makes. However, it is not always, so I am trying to debug everything to do not happen this anymore.
