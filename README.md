# rshell
This is the repository of the HW0, rshell. I have been struggling with git and I hope I learn one day. By now I am not sure if I am updating everything right or not and I feel I am going to cry.

# Installation
To execute the program just follow the steps:
<br>1 - Download the project
<br>2 - Open the terminal and go inside of the directory rshell
<br>3 - Once you are in the right folder, just type make. After that, type:
<br>`$ make run`
<br>to run the software or;
<br>`$ make leak-check`

# Dependencies
By now this software do not use any external library 

#Bugs/Limitations/Issues
Sometimes occurs unexpected erros which seems to be something releated with the mallocs that the new operator makes. However, it is not always, so I am trying to debug everything to do not happen this anymore.
