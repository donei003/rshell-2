# rshell
This is the repository of the HW0, rshell. This file is going to be updated yet.

# Installation
To execute the program just follow the steps:
<br>1 - Download the project
<br>2 - Open the terminal and go inside of the directory rshell
3 - Once you are in the right folder, just type make. After that, type:
`$ make run`
to run the software or;
`$ make leak-check`

# Dependencies
By now this software do not use any external library 

#Bugs/Limitations/Issues
Sometimes occurs unexpected erros which seems to be something releated with the mallocs that the new operator makes. However, it is not always, so I am trying to debug everything to do not happen this anymore.
